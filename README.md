 ## The following features are used in following application
 
* ### FusedLocationProviderClient
   \- The standard Android API usedfor reading GPS and cell phone tower location data.
   
* ### Permissions:
   \- Allowing an app to track the location of the phone

* ### Google Play Services:
   \- Info about this important dependency that google includes in many different applications, including GPS and Maps

 ## CONCLUSION
 * The accurate prediction model would allow investors or house buyers to determine the realistic price of a house as well as the house developers to decide the affordable house price. 
 * This  addressed the attributes used by previous researchers to forecast a house price using various prediction models. The models were developed based on several input attributes and they work significantly positive with house price. 
 * In conclusion, the impact of this research was intended to help and assist other researchers in developing a real model which can easily and accurately predict house prices. Further work on a real model needs to be done with the utilization of our findings to confirm them.
